Limnobium can form thick mats across the surface of the water, providing pleasant shade in aquarium environments, but becoming a nuisance to boaters, fish, and other plants in areas where it is considered invasive, including the state of California. Like many non-native tropical plants, climate change will likely exacerbate the spongeplant\'s impact as water temperatures rise and its range increases.﻿','Moderate to bright.','Free floating.
